# Story: Add Tour Description Content for East Hokkaido Tour

**Story**: As a bicycle touring enthusiast, I want to see a detailed narrative description of the East Hokkaido tour so that I can share the story and experiences of my journey.

**Status**: Complete

## Context

The current bicycle touring section displays the route on a map with metrics and photos, but lacks a narrative description of the tour. Adding this content will transform the page into a comprehensive tour showcase that combines visual elements with storytelling.

## Estimation

0.5 story points (approximately 5 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create a `TourDescription` component that can display narrative content
- [x] Implement the East Hokkaido tour description with day-by-day details
- [x] Integrate the tour description into the `BicycleTourPage` component
- [x] Ensure the design is responsive and works well on mobile devices
- [x] Support multiple tour descriptions (including a placeholder for Tokyo to Osaka)

## Subtasks

### Component Creation

- [x] Create a new `TourDescription.tsx` component
- [x] Implement Markdown rendering capability
- [x] Design an accordion interface for better content organization

### Content Integration

- [x] Format the East Hokkaido tour narrative as Markdown
- [x] Add a placeholder description for the Tokyo to Osaka tour
- [x] Organize content into logical sections (overview, day-by-day, reflections)

### UI Integration

- [x] Import and integrate the component into `BicycleTourPage.tsx`
- [x] Ensure the component responds to tour selection changes
- [x] Test the component with different tour selections

## Constraints

- TypeScript type safety must be maintained
- Design must be responsive and work well on all screen sizes
- Support Markdown formatting for rich content presentation

## Dev Notes

- Using Mantine's components for consistent styling
