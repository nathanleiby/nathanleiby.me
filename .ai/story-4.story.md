# Story 4: Implement GPX File Support for Bicycle Routes

## Story

**As a** bicycle touring enthusiast\
**I want** to see actual GPX data from my tours displayed on the map\
**so that** I can share accurate routes from my real-world bicycle journeys.

## Status

Complete

## Context

After implementing the basic map, route metrics, and photo gallery features, we now need to enhance the bicycle touring section to use real GPX data instead of sample routes. We have GPX files from a multi-day East Hokkaido tour in Japan, which we'll use as the source for route data. The GPX files contain detailed track information including coordinates, elevation, and timestamps.

## Estimation

Story Points: 0.8 (approximately 8 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] Parse GPX files to extract route data
2. - [x] Display the complete East Hokkaido tour on the map
3. - [x] Calculate accurate metrics based on GPX data
4. - [x] Support multi-day tours by combining multiple GPX files
5. - [x] Ensure the map is properly centered on the route
6. - [x] Maintain responsive design and performance

## Subtasks

1. - [x] GPX Parsing
   1. - [x] Create a GPX parser utility
   2. - [x] Extract track points, elevation, and timestamps
   3. - [x] Convert GPX data to RoutePoint format
   4. - [x] Handle multi-file tours
2. - [x] Route Display
   1. - [x] Update Map component to handle larger datasets
   2. - [x] Add markers for start/end points of each day
   3. - [x] Optimize rendering for performance
3. - [x] Route Metrics
   1. - [x] Update metrics calculation for GPX data
   2. - [x] Add support for multi-day statistics
   3. - [x] Display day-by-day breakdown
4. - [x] Tour Selection
   1. - [x] Create a tour selection interface
   2. - [x] Support multiple tours in the future
5. - [x] Testing
   1. - [x] Write unit tests for GPX parser
   2. - [x] Test with actual GPX files
   3. - [x] Test performance with large datasets
6. - [x] Documentation
   1. - [x] Add component documentation
   2. - [x] Update README with GPX support details

## Constraints

- Must maintain TypeScript type safety
- Must achieve minimum 80% test coverage
- Must handle large GPX files efficiently
- UI must be responsive and match existing design system
- Must use Mantine components for consistency

## Dev Notes

- Will use a lightweight GPX parser library or implement our own
- Need to handle potential issues with GPX data (missing points, elevation, etc.)
- Consider implementing data downsampling for very large GPX files
- Will need to update the route metrics calculations to handle real-world data
- Consider adding a loading state for large GPX files

## Progress Notes As Needed

### 2024-06-01

- Installed gpxparser library for parsing GPX files
- Created GPX parser utility with functions for parsing GPX strings, loading from URLs, and handling multi-day tours
- Implemented downsampling for large datasets to improve performance
- Added support for extracting elevation and timestamps from GPX data
- Created comprehensive unit tests for the parser functionality
- All tests are now passing for the GPX parser utility

### 2024-06-02

- Updated BicycleTourPage component to load and display GPX data from the East Hokkaido tour
- Added loading state with Mantine Loader component for better UX during data loading
- Implemented error handling for GPX file loading failures
- Updated Map component to automatically center on the route

- Implemented multi-day tour support by combining multiple GPX files
- Added performance optimizations for handling large GPX datasets

### 2024-06-03

- Created TourSelector component to allow users to choose between different tours
- Updated BicycleTourPage to use the TourSelector component
- Added support for multiple tours (East Hokkaido and Tokyo-Osaka)
- Implemented dynamic loading of tour data based on user selection
- Completed all acceptance criteria and subtasks for the story
