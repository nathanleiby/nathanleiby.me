# Story 4: Implement GPX File Support for Bicycle Routes

## Story

**As a** bicycle touring enthusiast\
**I want** to see actual GPX data from my tours displayed on the map\
**so that** I can share accurate routes from my real-world bicycle journeys.

## Status

Draft

## Context

After implementing the basic map, route metrics, and photo gallery features, we now need to enhance the bicycle touring section to use real GPX data instead of sample routes. We have GPX files from a multi-day East Hokkaido tour in Japan, which we'll use as the source for route data. The GPX files contain detailed track information including coordinates, elevation, and timestamps.

## Estimation

Story Points: 0.8 (approximately 8 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [ ] Parse GPX files to extract route data
2. - [ ] Display the complete East Hokkaido tour on the map
3. - [ ] Calculate accurate metrics based on GPX data
4. - [ ] Support multi-day tours by combining multiple GPX files
5. - [ ] Ensure the map is properly centered on the route
6. - [ ] Maintain responsive design and performance

## Subtasks

1. - [ ] GPX Parsing
   1. - [ ] Create a GPX parser utility
   2. - [ ] Extract track points, elevation, and timestamps
   3. - [ ] Convert GPX data to RoutePoint format
   4. - [ ] Handle multi-file tours
2. - [ ] Route Display
   1. - [ ] Update Map component to handle larger datasets
   2. - [ ] Add markers for start/end points of each day
   3. - [ ] Optimize rendering for performance
3. - [ ] Route Metrics
   1. - [ ] Update metrics calculation for GPX data
   2. - [ ] Add support for multi-day statistics
   3. - [ ] Display day-by-day breakdown
4. - [ ] Tour Selection
   1. - [ ] Create a tour selection interface
   2. - [ ] Support multiple tours in the future
5. - [ ] Testing
   1. - [ ] Write unit tests for GPX parser
   2. - [ ] Test with actual GPX files
   3. - [ ] Test performance with large datasets
6. - [ ] Documentation
   1. - [ ] Add component documentation
   2. - [ ] Update README with GPX support details

## Constraints

- Must maintain TypeScript type safety
- Must achieve minimum 80% test coverage
- Must handle large GPX files efficiently
- UI must be responsive and match existing design system
- Must use Mantine components for consistency

## Dev Notes

- Will use a lightweight GPX parser library or implement our own
- Need to handle potential issues with GPX data (missing points, elevation, etc.)
- Consider implementing data downsampling for very large GPX files
- Will need to update the route metrics calculations to handle real-world data
- Consider adding a loading state for large GPX files
