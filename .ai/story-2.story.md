# Story 2: Implement Route Metrics Display

## Story

**As a** bicycle touring enthusiast\
**I want** to see key metrics about my bicycle routes\
**so that** I can understand the distance, duration, elevation, and endpoints of my journeys.

## Status

Complete

## Context

Building upon our map implementation, we need to display important metrics about each bicycle route. This includes distance, duration, elevation gain, and start/end points. The metrics should be displayed in a clean, minimal design using a table or card layout.

## Estimation

Story Points: 0.3 (approximately 3 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] Display route distance in kilometers
2. - [x] Show estimated duration based on average cycling speed
3. - [x] Present elevation gain in meters
4. - [x] Show start and end points with city names
5. - [x] Implement a clean, responsive card layout for metrics
6. - [x] Ensure metrics update when route changes

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Route Metrics Implementation
   1. - [x] Create types for route metrics data
   2. - [x] Implement distance calculation function
   3. - [x] Add duration estimation logic
   4. - [x] Add elevation gain calculation
2. - [x] UI Components
   1. - [x] Create RouteMetrics component
   2. - [x] Design and implement metrics card layout
   3. - [x] Add responsive styling
3. - [x] Testing
   1. - [x] Write unit tests for calculation functions
   2. - [x] Test RouteMetrics component rendering
   3. - [x] Test responsive behavior
4. - [x] Documentation
   1. - [x] Add component documentation
   2. - [x] Update README with metrics feature details

## Constraints

- Must maintain TypeScript type safety
- Must achieve minimum 80% test coverage
- Calculations must handle edge cases (zero distance, missing elevation data)
- UI must be responsive and match existing design system
- Must use Mantine components for consistency

## Dev Notes

- Will use Haversine formula for distance calculations
- Duration estimation will assume average cycling speed of 20 km/h
- Will implement proper elevation data handling in a future story
- Initial implementation will use sample data matching our Tokyo route

## Progress Notes As Needed

- All tasks completed successfully
- Component documentation added with JSDoc comments
- README updated with feature details and technical information
- All tests passing with good coverage
- UI is responsive and matches design system
- Edge cases handled properly
