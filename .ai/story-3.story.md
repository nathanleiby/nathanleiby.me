# Story 3: Add Photo Gallery to Bicycle Tour Page

## Story

**As a** bicycle touring enthusiast\
**I want** to see photos from the bicycle route\
**so that** I can get a visual sense of the journey and locations.

## Status

Draft

## Context

After implementing the map and route metrics, we need to add a photo gallery to provide visual context for the bicycle route. The gallery should display 2-3 relevant photos in a grid or simple gallery format, hosted locally in the GitHub repo. The photos will be linked to the route section but won't need to be tied to specific points on the map.

## Estimation

Story Points: 0.4 (approximately 4 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [ ] Display 2-3 sample photos in a responsive grid layout
2. - [ ] Implement proper image loading and optimization
3. - [ ] Add photo captions or descriptions
4. - [ ] Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes
5. - [ ] Maintain visual consistency with existing components

## Subtasks

1. - [ ] Photo Management
   1. - [ ] Create photo assets directory
   2. - [ ] Add sample photos for the Tokyo route
   3. - [ ] Implement basic image optimization
2. - [ ] UI Components
   1. - [ ] Create PhotoGallery component
   2. - [ ] Design and implement grid layout
   3. - [ ] Add responsive styling
   4. - [ ] Implement image captions
3. - [ ] Integration
   1. - [ ] Add PhotoGallery to BicycleTourPage
   2. - [ ] Ensure proper layout with existing components
4. - [ ] Testing
   1. - [ ] Write unit tests for PhotoGallery component
   2. - [ ] Test responsive behavior
   3. - [ ] Test image loading states
5. - [ ] Documentation
   1. - [ ] Add component documentation
   2. - [ ] Update README with photo gallery details

## Constraints

- Must maintain TypeScript type safety
- Must achieve minimum 80% test coverage
- Photos must be hosted locally in the repo
- UI must be responsive and match existing design system
- Must use Mantine components for consistency

## Dev Notes

- Will use Mantine's Image and SimpleGrid components for layout
- Photos will be stored in public/images/bicycle-tour/
- Initial implementation will use sample photos for the Tokyo route
- Will implement basic image optimization (no CDN required)
- Consider implementing lazy loading for better performance
