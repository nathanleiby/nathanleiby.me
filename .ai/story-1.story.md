# Story 1: Implement Basic Map Integration with Leaflet

## Story

**As a** bicycle touring enthusiast\
**I want** to see my bicycle routes displayed on an interactive map\
**so that** I can visualize my journeys effectively.

## Status

Complete

## Context

The website needs a new bicycle touring section where routes can be displayed on maps. We will use Leaflet for map integration as it is lightweight and open-source. For the initial implementation, we will work with a simulated GPX route (Tokyo → Osaka → Kyoto → Tokyo) to establish the basic functionality.

## Estimation

Story Points: 0.2 (approximately 2 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] Leaflet map is properly integrated into the React application
2. - [x] A sample route (Tokyo → Osaka → Kyoto → Tokyo) is displayed on the map
3. - [x] Map is responsive and displays correctly on different screen sizes
4. - [x] Basic map controls (zoom, pan) are functional
5. - [x] Route is displayed as a static line with appropriate styling

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Setup and Configuration
   1. - [x] Install and configure Leaflet and React-Leaflet
   2. - [x] Create basic map component structure
   3. - [x] Add necessary TypeScript types
2. - [x] Map Implementation
   1. - [x] Create sample GPX route data
   2. - [x] Implement basic map display
   3. - [x] Add route overlay
3. - [x] Testing
   1. - [x] Write unit tests for map component
   2. - [x] Test route rendering
   3. - [x] Test responsive behavior
4. - [x] Documentation
   1. - [x] Add component documentation
   2. - [x] Update README with new feature details

## Constraints

- Must use Leaflet for map implementation
- Initial implementation should focus on static route display
- Must be responsive across different screen sizes
- Must follow TypeScript best practices
- Must achieve minimum 80% test coverage

## Dev Notes

- Will use React-Leaflet for better React integration
- Sample route coordinates will be hardcoded for initial implementation
- Will implement proper GPX file handling in a future story

## Progress Notes As Needed

- Successfully integrated Leaflet map with React application
- Implemented sample route display with Tokyo → Osaka → Kyoto → Tokyo
- Added responsive design with appropriate styling
- Basic map functionality (zoom, pan) is working correctly
- Completed unit tests with 100% coverage for the Map component
- All acceptance criteria have been met
